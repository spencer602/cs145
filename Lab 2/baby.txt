I chose a mixture of yellow, orange, and green for the color palette for a baby food company, with yellow and green being the primary colors. Yellow is the primary color due to its inherent moods of happy and joy. Branding baby food with vibes of happiness and joy goes hand in hand with the image of a smiling, happy baby. Green is the second primary color to give feelings of nature and growth. For parents choosing food to feed their baby, a common theme is clean, natural food to aid in a babyâ€™s healthy growth. Orange is the secondary color here to offer a childlike feeling, along with extra emphasis on happiness and joy.
