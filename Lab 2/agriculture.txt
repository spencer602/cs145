I chose a mixture of shades of reds and blues in the color palette for an agricultural machining company. The priority color here is red because in agricultural work the massive area of land that the machinery needs work calls for powerful, fast equipment. Underpowered or otherwise inefficient equipment will result in poor efficiency, frustrating days of operating the machinery, and likely an overall lower revenue. Blue is the secondary color with the intention of emphasizing peaceful, calming, and professional vibes. A worker will be spending a great deal of time operating the equipment, making peaceful and calming feelings important. Professional is inherent in Agriculture work (ever met a large scale farmer who doesnâ€™t intend to turn a profit?), and therefore also an important takeaway from the red color.
