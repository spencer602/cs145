<h1>Lab 3 (2nd tech lab): CSS</h1>
<h2>What is needed:</h2>
The lectures on Monday and Tuesday of this week will both be needed to
complete this lab. This assignment will be due Thursday by 5pm.
<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>
  The purpose of this lab is to give you hands-on experience with external
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) stylesheets.  You should use a text editor
  such as Notepad++ to do this assignment.
</p>

<h2>Partners</h2>

<p>
  Everyone is very encouraged to work with a partner, after this week
every lab must be done with a partner, this is one of your last chances to find a partner
before you start losing points. If you understand CSS,
  sharing your knowledge with someone else will benefit both you and
  your partner.
</p>

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On your computer (z drive if on campus computers) create a directory
named <b>lab3</b>.
      Pull up today's lab web page in a separate tab by control-clicking on
      this <a href="sum16Lab3css.html">link</a>.  You will know you have done
      this correctly if the tab's title is <i>Lab 3: CSS</i>.
      View the source of this file and save it to a file named
      <b>index.html</b> that is
      located in the directory.</li>
  <li>Create a subdirectory in <b>lab3</b> named <b>css</b>.</li>
  <li>Create a subdirectory in <b>lab3</b> named <b>images</b>.</li>
  <li>Notice that there is an external stylesheet link in index.html
      that references a file named index.css that is located in the
      <b>css</b> subdirectory. <b>You will need to create this css
file.</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Requirements and Grading - 10 points</h2>
